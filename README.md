# Weather Dashboard app 

## Description

This weather dashboard gets its weather information from the OpenWeather API. Current and upcoming weather for the city are shown when a user searches for it, and the city is preserved in the search history to "localStorage" as well. When a button in the history panel is clicked, the forecast for that city is displayed on the page.
